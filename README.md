Language: MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE, Java

Authors: Casey Ranft and Alex Garlotte

Problem: Implement database mySQL concepts and technology in combination with Java. Must include insertion, deletion, and updating of database. Can work with a partner or alone.

Description: My partner Alex and I decided to create a wine database and GUI in java. Our program can be broken down into parts based off interfaces and application. We focused on imitating a usable ranking website that would contain a user profile and database of wines available. The main purpose was to allow the user to rank/filter results based off the features then be able to add wines to their profile.

mySQL inputs:
- Contains a set of pre-inputted wines with multiple features such as brand, price, type, compatiable food, etc which have some values subject to change.
- mySQL contains a set of hard inputted drinking ages from around the world that cannot be changed.

User Profile which can be created or signed into:
- Java Interface for signing in which containes a username/password verification and current wines associated with their profile.
- Java Interface for creating a profile with username/password, country, and date of birth - Used to verify the drinking age.

Main Java wine database interface:
- GUI Table that displays a list of wine
